                    <p>Papua Island, the part of the Indonesian eastern region, is the region that is more devolved with natural resources, great biodiversity, and known for its conservation designation.</p> 
                    <p>My parents were having their business right on Papua Island, my two siblings and I were raised there. Personally, as someone who grew up in Papua Island, which is one of the islands in Indonesia that is known for its ecosystem diversity, including both marine and forest, I was amazed and found nature to be the only entertainment that I would always seek. In particular, I deeply love the ocean and have always searched for great places to swim together with my family members.</p>
                    <p>The fondness towards the ocean has been proceeding even deeper and led me to the eagerness in experiencing scuba diving. Unexpectedly, during my 2024 summer break, I went back to my hometown. It was the time when I did try scuba diving and swam up to a depth of 20 m. I could say that scuba diving was such a surreal experience, seeing that I was able to view the underwater world as well as acknowledge the various types and looks of fish.</p>
